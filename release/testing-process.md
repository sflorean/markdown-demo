Fenix Testing
=============

Overview
--------

We are testing all 3 channels but with small differences:
- Bug verification/investigation done on all channels
- Full-functional testing - done on Beta
- Smoke & sanity testing - done on all channels
- Features (creating test cases, bug verification, a11y) - done mostly on Nightly but we check also on Beta after the feature is landed
- Exploratory testing - all channels
- l10n - done on Beta
- Bug triage - mostly on Nightly but depends of the issue, we check the exact steps provided by the user
